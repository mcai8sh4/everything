Everything
==========

The theory is simple - if we create every possible colour of every pixel in an image, we would result in having
every image every - past and present!!

So this simply creates every image that can ever be created.
It's purely a POC as it would be impossible to run this program. But the theory checks out!

Compile with gcc (or similar) it has been designed to compile using only standard libs.
